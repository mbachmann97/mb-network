## Examples

### ü¶Ñ First steps
It is recommended to always use the functions *newIp* and *newSubnet* for creating new Ip's and Subnet's. Although you don't need to.

```ts
import { newIp, newSubnet, subnetToString } from 'mb-network'

const ip = newIp('192.168.0.11')
const subnet = newSubnet(ip, 24)

console.log(subnetToString(subnet)) // logs -> 192.168.0.0/24
```

### üî¢üî§ About numbers and strings
In mb-network Ip's are stored as a single number. To convert them to the well known readable format e.g. 192.168.0.1 you need to use the function *ipToString*.
It was a design decision to have the subnet functions, such as *broadcast*, also return the ip as a number (type Ip). <br /> This approach opens up more options for further working with the results.

```ts
import { newSubnet, broadcast, ipToString } from 'mb-network'

// You can also create a subnet without first creating an ip
const subnet = newSubnet('192.168.0.1', 24)
const broadcastOfSubnet = broadcast(subnet)

console.log(broadcastOfSubnet) // logs -> 3232235775
console.log(ipToString(broadcastOfSubnet)) // logs -> 192.168.0.255

// For example, this allows us to perform the following, offering maximum flexibility.
console.log(broadcastOfSubnet - 10) // logs -> 3232235765
console.log(ipToString(broadcastOfSubnet - 10)) // logs -> 192.168.0.245
```

### üç© Looping around
A subnet object consists solely of a network address (Ip) and a suffix (number). But what if you need to work with the addresses within the subnet? <br />
For this purpose mb-network provides two **iterators**. A general address iterator *newSubnetIter(): SubnetIter* and a host address iterator *newSubnetHostIter(): SubnetIter* <br />
This iterators sit on top of a subnet and are ***not*** a direct part of it as you may know it from Arrays.

#### Spreading a subnet
```ts
import { newSubnet, newSubnetIter }

const subnet = newSubnet('192.168.0.5', 28)
const iter = newSubnetIter(subnet) // Iterator over all addresses including network address and broadcast

const addresses = [...iter] // Array<Ip>
```

#### Classic for..of loop
````ts
import { newSubnet, newSubnetHostIter }

const subnet = newSubnet('192.168.0.5', 28)
const iter = newSubnetHostIter(subnet) // Iterator over all host addresses

for (const host of iter) {
  // do something with host address (Ip)
}
````

#### Manual consumption
````ts
import { newSubnet, newSubnetIter, ipToString }

const subnet = newSubnet('192.168.0.5', 28)
const iter = newSubnetIter(subnet)

// skip first three addresses (for some reason)
iter.next()
iter.next()
iter.next()

// do something with the rest
let result = iter.next();
while (!result.done) {
  const address = iter.next().value
  console.log(ipToString(address))
  result = iter.next();    
}
````

#### So exhausting..
Compared to e.g. the Array iterator these iterators will be exhausted after one use. Trying to consume an iterator twice will result in an Error. <br />
Although the infinite iterator usage of an Array could be mimicked, we would then lose the classical "manual consumption" method of consuming the iterator.
